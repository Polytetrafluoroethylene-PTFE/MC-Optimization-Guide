# MC-Optimization-Guide

The end-all, be-all optimization guide for various Minecraft versions.

**NOTE:**
This guide only covers performance mods that are deemed "necessary", so duplicate mods that do the same thing (eg. Rubidium and Embeddium, Radon and Starlight, etc.) won't be included.

It also takes a fairly minimalist approach. This means that while there may be a way to squeeze out a couple fps more with additional mods, the mods listed here should be more than enough for smooth and lag-free gameplay.

Inspired by [UsefulMods](https://github.com/TheUsefulLists/UsefulMods) and various Reddit threads, as well as my own testing.

## FAQ
Q: What happened to Rad? Why was the original repository deleted?

A: He deleted his [GitHub](https://github.com/Radk6/), Reddit, and possibly Discord accounts. The reason is unknown.

Q: Why isn't `mod x` on any of the lists?

A: A list of mods that aren't recommended (and why) can be found [here](mods-n-stuff/not-recommended.md). Similarly, a list of situational performance mods which may help in some specific scenarios can be found [here](/mods-n-stuff/additions.md)

Q: Why isn't `version x.y.z` supported?

A: I only maintain lists for Minecraft versions that still see active mod development.

Q: Isn’t it better to just use an optimization modpack?

Q:The guide aims to provide the best balance between number of mods and performance. Optimization modpacks usually include additional mods that aren’t strictly performance-related. If you want the best performance with the fewest mods, use the guide. If you prefer something more plug-and-play or with extra QoL mods, then use an optimization modpack.

Q: Will these work on PojavLauncher?

A: Maybe, maybe not. Try it and see. Pojav compatibility isn't a priority since most players are on PC.
