## Cleanroom Loader

**NOTE:** Do not use MixinBooter/MixinBootstrap and ConfigAnytime! They're not necessary on Cleanroom.

| Mod | Notes | Client/Server |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Alfheim Lighting Engine | - | Server |
| CensoredASM | - | Both |
| Entity Culling | There are 2 mods going by that name, the one I'd recommend is by tr7zw. There is an edge case where Entity Culling can crash the game. See [this](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium/issues/2985) for more info | Client |
| Fixeroo | - | Both |
| Nothirium | If you're using CensoredASM, install Naughthirium as well, otherwise animations won't work. **Not compatible with Celeritas, you have to use one or the other** | Client |
| StellarCore | Disable `NBTTagImprovements`, `ParallelModelLoader`, `ResourceExistStateCache` and `ResourceLocationCanonicalization` as CensoredASM and VintageFix already have similar optimizations. | Both |
| UniversalTweaks | - | Both |
| VintageFix | - | Both |

### Celeritas

Celeritas is a port of Embeddium for various versions of Minecraft, and is currently easily obtainable for 1.12.2 via Kappa Maintainer's repo: https://github.com/kappa-maintainer/Celeritas-auto-build/releases.

Current known incompatibilities:
- Chunk Animator (Celeritas itself has a similar-ish setting)
- LittleTiles
- Nothirium
- OptiFine
- Vintagium and its' forks (Relictium, Neonium)

Shader support isn't currently available, however it is W.I.P.

Since this [commit](https://git.taumc.org/embeddedt/celeritas/commit/9e2253f05202ec3e9d96a43f45e1008069b9dce8), Celeritas is able to run on Forge; however, based on my testing, the performance gains compared to Cleanroom Loader (or lwjgl3ify-colorful, but it has worse mod compatibility so I can't recommend it) are significantly lower.
